        The Zone Diet is a low-glycemic load diet that has you limit carbs to 35–45% of daily calories and protein and fat to 30% each.

        It recommends eating only carbs with a low glycemic index (GI).

        The GI of a food is an estimate of how much it raises your blood glucose levels after consumption.

        The Zone Diet was initially developed to reduce diet-induced inflammation, cause weight loss, and reduce your risk of chronic diseases.

        How it works: The Zone Diet recommends balancing each meal with 1/3 protein, 2/3 colorful fruits and veggies, and a dash of fat — namely monounsaturated oil, such as olive oil, avocado, or almonds.

        It also limits high-GI carbs, such as bananas, rice, and potatoes.

        Weight loss: Studies on low-GI diets are rather inconsistent. While some say that the diet promotes weight loss and reduces appetite, others show very little weight loss compared to other diets.

        Other benefits: The greatest benefit of this diet is a reduction in risk factors for heart disease, such as reduced cholesterol and triglycerides.

        One study suggests that the Zone Diet may improve blood sugar control, reduce waist circumference, and lower chronic inflammation in overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.

        The downside: One of the few drawbacks of this diet is that it limits the consumption of some healthy carb sources, such as bananas and potatoes.
